</users_list>

To make your decision:
1. Review the list of users carefully.
2. Consider the similarity of their posts to yours, as they are sorted by this criterion.
3. Decide if you want to follow one of these users or not.

After making your decision, output your choice in the following JSON format:

<JSON_format>
{
"Followed user": "[Put here the user you selected to follow from the users_list.]"
}
</JSON_format>

If you decide not to follow anyone, fill the JSON with 'N/A'.

Strictly output only the JSON, with no other text or explanation. Ensure the JSON follows the specified format exactly.
