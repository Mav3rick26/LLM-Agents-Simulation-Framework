# ü§ñ *A simulation framework designed to study complex social dynamics using generative agents powered by LLMs*
[![CC BY-NC 4.0][cc-by-nc-shield]][cc-by-nc]

This repository contains a **Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM)** framework that integrates **Large Language Models (LLMs)** into *agent-based simulations*. It enables the study of emergent social behaviors in complex environments such as social networks, content virality, and opinion dynamics.

## üîç Framework Overview
This framework adopts a modular, phase-based approach to simulate and analyze interactions within a social environment. The simulation workflow is divided into several phases, each contributing to the realistic modeling of agent interactions. Agents dynamically evolve within the simulated social network, making autonomous decisions based on memory, personality, and environmental feedback. More details can be found in our published papers cited below.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language ([Python](https://www.python.org/))
- **PyAutogen**: LLM-powered agent automation ([PyAutogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen))
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis ([Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/))
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database for memory management ([ChromaDB Documentation](https://docs.trychroma.com/))

## üåü Key Features
- **LLM-Powered Generative Agents**: Agents dynamically reason and adapt to the environment.
- **RAG-Driven Responses**: Combines powerful retrieval systems with generative models to provide different content recommendations to agents.
- **Memory Mechanisms**: Agents retain and prioritize past interactions.
- **Emergent Social Phenomena**: Agents naturally replicates real-world social phenomena.
